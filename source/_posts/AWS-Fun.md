Creating serverless applications and websites with AWS can be very easy. I think the trickier parts, in my opinion, are weaving together all of the permissions and endpoints. You can create a static webpage super fast and easy with technically nothing but an S3 bucket. But this is very unsecure. 

Amazon's definition of CloudFront is "a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment." This is what I put in front of the S3 buckets rather than simply leaving them open to the public. I'm still learning the finer points of how all this works.

More to come though... if I can master this I will have newfound super powers.
