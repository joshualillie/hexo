I was able to get Terraform set up and running in only a few minutes. One thing that did trip me up was that I had the Execution Mode in my Workspace set to "Remote" instead of "Local", and therefore my AWS credential settings were not working correctly. Eventually (probalby never) I will set up the variables in my Terraform Workspace.

Now I can set up my cloud infrastructure for each project. And when I forget about them, it will be easier to resurrect them again.
