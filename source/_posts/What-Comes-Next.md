### What Comes Next?
Now that joshlillie.com has been reborn on Hexo, moved to GitHub, and is running serverlessly on AWS, I need to get some DNS set up. Then I can get Route53 set up and my site will be "real". 

Then what?

Time to start learning the ins and outs of Hexo and prattling out some thoughts I guess. I think it is also time to figure out how to add some media to this thing.
